            <h2> Flight Prices Prediction </h2>
            <p>Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how unexpectedly the prices vary. (More information <a href="https://www.cheapair.com/blog/airfare-fluctuations-can-a-flight-price-really-change-135-times/">
                here </a>.
                Airlines use using sophisticated quasi-academic tactics which they call "revenue management" or "yield management".
                The cheapest available ticket on a given flight gets more and less expensive over time. This usually happens as an attempt to maximize revenue based on -
                <ul>
                    <li>Time of purchase patterns i.e. making sure last-minute purchases are expensive)</li>
                    <li>Keeping the flight as full as they want it i.e. raising prices on a flight which is filling up 
                        in order to reduce sales and hold back inventory for those expensive last-minute expensive purchases</li>
                </ul>
            <p> More information <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/how-do-airlines-price-seat-tickets.html"> here. </a></p>
            <p> With 102,465 flights per day, consumers are looking for the cheapest way to get around the world. As a personal frequent flyer I have several questions
                about the aviation industry. The questions I often ask myself are:
                <ul>
                    <li> When is the best time to book tickets? </li>
                    <li> Does the optimum time vary on the basis of destination and origin? </li>
                    <li> How do prices vary across airlines and how much am I compromising on comfort? </li>
                    <li> What is the best time to buy so that I can save the most by taking the least risk?</li>
                    <li> Do prices tend to go up or down over time?</li>
                    <li> Does the time or day of the flight matter on price? </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                </p>

            <h2> Existing Solutions</h2>
            <p> Existing solutions are built into the major flight-booking apps 
                such as <a href="https://www.expedia.com/">Expedia </a>, <a href="https://www.booking.com/"> Booking.com etc.</a> </p>
            <p> The problems which such web apps is that it shows you the _current_ trend for the next week.
                <a href="https://www.skyscanner.com/transport/flights-from/us/?adults=1&children=0&adultsv2=1&childrenv2=&infants=0&cabinclass=economy&rtn=1&preferdirects=false&outboundaltsenabled=false&inboundaltsenabled=false&ref=home">
                    SkyScanner also provides services to set up alerts on low prices </a> But, this doesn't anticipate a further dip or increase in price in the future, therefore the uncertainty prevails. </p>
            <p> Additionally, we, as consumers don't know if their loyalties lie with airline companies (to help them earn the maximum possible revenue) or with consumers (to provide them with affordable air tickets) </p>     
        </section>

        <section class="application">
            <h2> Proposed Application </h2>
            <p> I plan to use the
            <a href="https://www.partners.skyscanner.net/contact/affiliates?hsCtaTracking=192542a2-23c6-42d8-839b-146da042358b%7C23f0319b-b2e5-488b-8971-116fe0b91ec6"> Sky Scanner API</a>
            to build a web app to show trends in flight prices in a complete and data driven manner.
            </p>
            <subsection class="functionality">
                <p> Here is what the web app would typically do:
                    <ol>
                        <li> Users will be able to enter the their origin and destination location. </li>
                        <li> This will produce a trend chart of the most recent prices across all airlines. </li>
                        <li> They will be able to filter these results for class of travel, number of stops, airlines etc. </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection class="potential-users">
                <h3> Potential Users </h3>
                <p> 4.1 billion passengers flew in airlines in 2017. My webapp will target this vast multitude of people who are looking for affordable 
                    flights to get to were they want to be, when they want to be there. 
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <h3>How will this help?</h3>
            <p> I believe this web app will answer all the aforementioned questions I personally had as a flyer.
                I also aim to build trust of consumers by proving loyalties to consumers rather than airlines, this will set this web app apart from all the major
                existing solutions.
