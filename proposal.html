            <h2> Overview </h2>
            <p> There are a lot of great projects produced by people.
                Project Hub is a one-stop-shop to show case any projects you worked on
                whether it was for a class, capstone, a hackathon or even a passion project.
                Your project can be anything from Software Development and Data Science to Graphic Design and UI/UX Design!
                <br>What if you don't have any projects to showcase? Don't worry!
                Project Hub can also help users find budding projects in need of your skills and time.

            <h2> Existing Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> brings together the world's 
                    largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better
                    software. It has capability to have open source projects to private team ones 
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>
                is a platform to showcase all your research projects with the ability
                to upload sources from Github, Dropbox and Amazon S3
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What's missing?</h3>
            <p>The point of showcasing projects are to show them off. It is a great way to
                show the world your skills while working on a topic that intrigues you as
                well as add value to the world with a working prototype that people can use.
                Although, the existing solutions are great to be able to collaborate on projects,
                they are not good ways to "show-off" projects
