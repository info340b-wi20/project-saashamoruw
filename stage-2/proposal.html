                <h2> Overview </h2>

                <p>What if you don't have any projects to showcase? Don't worry!
                    Project Hub can also help users find budding projects in need of your highlights and time.

                <h2> Existing Solutions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> brings together the world's 
                        largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better
                        software. It has capability to have open source projects to private team ones

                <h3>What's missing?</h3>
                <p>The point of showcasing projects are to show them off. It is a great way to
                    show the world your highlights while working on a topic that intrigues you as
                    well as add value to the world with a working prototype that people can use.
                    Although, the existing solutions are great to be able to collaborate on projects,
                    they are not good ways to "show-off" projects

                        <li>Most of other platforms have too much unnecessary information about projects. Therefore, Project Hub

                        <li>Great project ideas are rare. But when they do come around, you need the <strong>perfect team</strong> to make it come
                            to life. Project Hub provides an easy way to find team members that identify with your desired ethos.
